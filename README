Apache/FakeTable version 0.05
=============================

This class emulates the behavior of the Apache::Table class.

Apache::FakeTable is designed to behave exactly like Apache::Table, and
differs in only one respect. When a given key has multiple values in an
Apache::Table object, one can fetch each of the values for that key using
Perl's each operator:

  while (my ($k, $v) = each %$table) {
      push @cookies, $v if lc $k eq 'set-cookie';
  }

If anyone knows how Apache::Table does this, let us know! In the meantime, use
get() or do() to get at all of the values for a given key (they're much more
efficient, anyway).
